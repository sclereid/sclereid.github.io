 A website (the particular one that you are reading), in which I try to share my feeling by writing articles. However, the pace of updating is quite steady, and inevitably slow. But I have always been trying to present more material and to create a nicer interface.

| epicycles | February, 2017   | finished | article: [About Epicycles](https://sclereid.github.io/epicycles/) | [on github](https://github.com/sclereid/epicycles)

 
 A small program written to display animated epicycles with a given image. It is based on the FFT transform, which was a little bit incomprehensible for me at that time. Cooperating with a senior who was studying in collage, we managed to finished it in April.
 
 For more details, read my article or check out the project address.

 A collection of my fragment of codes. A place to manage the things created through learning. The majority of the code is Scheme, however, I usually use Julia to create plots and analyze data, and use C or python on my Raspberry Pi, and C++ for some sort of detailed problems. And there are some time when I was trying to learn the concepts of functional or logical programming, so you can find a little bit Haskell and Prolog in this place.
 
 Anyway, all of these are mainly hobbies. I do not major in CS/EE or Software Engineering.
